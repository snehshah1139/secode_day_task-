# Project Title
## Noise Complaint Insights from Urban Data

### Track
AI/ML Engineering Internship (Top 10 PPO Challenge)

---

# Problem Statement
Understanding urban noise complaints is crucial for improving city life.  
This EDA explores a synthetic yet realistic dataset to:

- Extract valuable patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Guide predictive modeling and policy decisions

---

# Objective

Perform insightful, visually-driven EDA to uncover:
- Key trends and correlations  
- Potential anomalies  
- Feature-level inferences for ML readiness
